<b>Design Thought Process</b><br> 
The controller is modeled around the ghosts in PAC-Man. Since the ghosts have big eyes that indicate the direction in which they are traveling, the eye on the left side of the controller acts as the joystick for movement. Having the physical pupil point in the direction the virtual ghost is traveling creates an amusing visual effect and additional immersion for the player. There is a large button next to this joystick, also shaped like an eyeball. Pressing this button gives the ghost a brief opportunity to phase through a non-boundary wall of the maze. This ability makes sense for PAC-Man as ghosts are typically non corporeal, and can travel through physical barriers. Finally, the controller contains a motor, and will rumble gently while PAC-Man is in his powered state, and a bit more aggressively if the ghost is eaten. This creates additional immersion, allowing the player to feel anticipation and possibly a small sensation of panic. <br>
